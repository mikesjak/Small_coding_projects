# One way linked list

### Sumary

- This directory is just a beggining of my journey throung Linked lits.
- Here I want to show you, how to create a simple linked list and how it works. 
- Notice, how easier it is to write a linked list in Python than in C.
- Remember, in Python you don't have to free your memory. Python does it by itself.
- I wanted to use same function set as it the first directory.

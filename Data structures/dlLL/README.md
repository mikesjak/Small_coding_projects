# Double linked list

### Sumary

- In this directory You can find a C code showing how to write a Double linked list with a simple function set.
- Remember that you have to allocate and free memory by yourself.
- I tried to use same functions as in previous 2 files. Only think I know that i changed, that i don't have a function to create a single Node because it would not be as efficient as in owLL.
- The best thing at Double linked lists is that you can move throuhg it faster than in One way linked list.

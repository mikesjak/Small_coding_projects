# From Linked lists to Binary trees

### Sumary

- This repository was made to show you guyys how to prepare for using binary trees
- We will go through One way linked list, Double linked lists and then move on to the Binary trees.
- All codes will be written in C and then in Python to simplify you the problem if you didn't quite understand it in C
- Feel free to open an issue if you think, I could do something better
